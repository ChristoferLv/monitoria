The forest was quiet that morning. The birds had not yet begun their song, and the wind barely stirred the leaves.
Among the trees, the fox moved silently. The fox was searching for something—perhaps food, or perhaps just a path.
It wasn't the first time the fox had walked this trail, and it wouldn't be the last.
The fox paused near a fallen log. The smell of something familiar lingered.
"The forest remembers," the old owl had once said.
The fox did not believe in such things, but today, the forest felt different.
A rustle, a shadow—then silence again.
The fox continued forward, its eyes fixed ahead, its ears alert.
In the forest, everything has meaning. Even the steps of a fox.
